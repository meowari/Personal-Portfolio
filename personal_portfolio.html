        <p class="intro">Greetings! I'm Anne, and it's a pleasure to connect with you.</p>
        <p class="intro">The inspiration behind my name, Anne, stems from my father's affection for "Anne of the Green Gables" by Montgomery. It was a reflection of his love for reading and pursuit of knowledge, a legacy he has instilled in me. My middle name, Miki (美樹), translates to "beautiful tree," a symbolism I've embraced as a guiding principle. Much like the majestic sequoias I admired during a visit to Yosemite, I strive to grow my skills, establishing strong roots to support personal and professional flourishing.</p>
        <p class="intro">I welcome any thoughts or conversations. Don't hesitate to reach out—I look forward to connecting with you.</p>
